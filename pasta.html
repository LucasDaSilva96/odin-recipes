    <p>
      This creamy pasta bake is one of my favorite midweek pasta dishes. My
      whole family loves it, and there is not much prep. Once the pasta bake is
      in the oven, you can make a salad or set the table, and then it's time to
      eat.

      <li><p>2 tablespoons tomato paste</p></li>

      <li><p>1 pound cherry tomatoes, halved</p></li>
      <li><p>1 ¼ cups shredded mozzarella cheese</p></li>
      <li><p>1 small bunch fresh basil, finely chopped</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking
          dish.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and
          cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about
          11 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 cup cooking water.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook onion in oil
          until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook for
          an additional 30 seconds. Stir in tomato sauce and tomato paste and
          cook until slightly reduced, about 5 minutes. Add cream and Parmesan
          cheese. Season with sugar, salt, and pepper.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Stir some of the reserved pasta water into sauce and add cooked penne.
          Remove from the heat and stir in cherry tomatoes, 1/2 of the
          mozzarella cheese, and basil. Add more pasta water if needed to reach
          desired consistency. Pour penne mixture into the prepared baking dish
          and cover with remaining mozzarella cheese.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and cheese is melted, about 20
          minutes.
        </p>
